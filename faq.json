Effectively there are buildings that aren't or cannot be moved out of the way of buildings in the layout you're trying to use.

      "question": "What is Error 2420?",
      "answer": "Error 2420 appears if you have junk on your PVP base, or when buildings overlap when you try to update your war base layout. “But, but, I updated my war base, not my PVP base?!?!”, I hear you cry. Yup. Just one of those SWC things that doesn’t make sense. To fix it, you need to have a clear up on your base.  "
